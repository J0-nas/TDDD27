# Project Mousika

## Project Description

Mousika is a music trivia quiz. Heavily inspired by https://www.thesongclash.com/de/quiz and similar games.

It's standard game mode is to guess the artist and title of 10 songs played consecutively (30 second  preview - obtained from the free napster api). Due to its nature it should be used with a keyboard (desktop PC/notebook). The players hear the same song at the same time and collect points based on how fast they solve the artist and title. A player can join the game at any point and is in sync with the song currently played.

Besides the 10 round game, each song has a record - minimum time a player needed to solve it - such that players can try to break the existing record.

The website includes an optional player profile, a live chat and optional (may have) features.



## Technologic Description

- We use **React** (and Phoenix.js) for the html code generation and client side logic used in our single page application (SPA)
  - In addition to React we use **React-Boostrap** to keep our code easy-readable and at the same time make our website responsive
  - The react code transpiled to javascript using a **webpack** setup
- The server is implemented using the **Phoenix** framework - written in **Elixir**
  - Elixir has been chose due to its different - functional - programming paradigm and its excelent server capabilities (Error handling, concurrency performance/scalability)
  - Since we are SPA the server returns a static html file (+js files) and changes the client side state using JSON responses 
  - We want to try to deploy our server to the new **openshift 3 ida server**
- As a database we use the open source alternative to MySQL - **MariaDB**
  - We chose **MariaDB** because we already used SQLite in the previous course and want to focus more on new server and client technologies

## Page layout - Not revised

### Footer (user information)

* unregistered
  * how many songs played
  * how many songs correct
* registered
  * name (clickable to view users main page)
  * how many songs played

  * on repage load offer an overlay where to choose the "substage" (as then the user knows what to expect); an "ESC" brings the user directly to the "main stage"
* timer (nice and beautiful; not like on thesongclash_com; that's too much)
* input box (one for artist; another for title)
  * RETURN-key inputs the result
    * background changes color if wrong/right
* panels to set the artist and title in a nice way 
* place to set the cover, year (other information?)
* if the user gets a new highscore --> fadein-notification at the left side
* show previous results in a nicer way than thesongclash_com
